# PyTorch-Libraries-For-Computer-Vision

Here is a list of handy libraries to help you with developing under PyTorch framework.
1. <a href="https://albumentations.readthedocs.io/ ">Albumentations : </a>
  A fast image augmentation library based on highly-optimized OpenCV library. Super simple yet powerful interface for different tasks (like segmentation, detection, etc.), that could be easily customized. Even though the library could be used not only under PyTorch framework, it has PyTorch helpers in its submodule albumentations.pytorch to make working with PyTorch tensors as easy as possible.
  
2. <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/tensorboard/ ">Tensorboard : </a>
  Starting with version 1.2 PyTorch integrates with TensorBoard, a tool designed for visualizing the results of neural network training runs. It comes extremely helpful to see whatâ€™s happening during your training. It provides tracking and visualizing metrics such as loss and accuracy, visualizing the model graph (ops and layers), viewing histograms of weights, biases, or other tensors as they change over time, displaying images, text, and audio data and much more.
  
3. <a href="https://www.wandb.com/ ">Weights & biases : </a>
  This is an experiment tracking tool for machine learning. Its background process collects useful data about what is happening as you train your models. For example, it can track model performance metrics, hyperparameters, gradients, system metrics, output files, and your most recent git commit. Again, like in case of the Albumentations library, Weights & biases is framework agnostic. COMPUTER VISION RESOURCES COPYRIGHT 2015 SATYA MALLICK
  
4. <a href="https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmdetection ">MMDetection: </a>
  MMDetection is an object detection toolbox based on PyTorch that contains a rich set of object detection and instance segmentation methods. It started from a codebase of MMDet team who won the detection track of COCO Challenge 2018. It gradually evolves into a unified platform that covers many popular detection methods. By now it provides weights for more than 200 network models.

5. <a href=" https://www.fast.ai/">Fast.ai : </a>
  The fast.ai library could be thought of as an independent framework, based on PyTorch. It simplifies training fast and accurate neural nets. For doing so, it uses modern best practices, including "out of the box" support for vision, text, tabular, and collaborative filtering models.
